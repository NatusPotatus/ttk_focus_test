# ttk_focus_test
Trying to figure out how to correctly code different focus commands so I can implement them into another program I'm messing around with.

TODO:
Have the label change when focus is changed.
Have the label change to "No focus" when no focus is placed.
Add different widgets that can 'gain' focus.
Change entry text to also show which widget has focus.
~~
SOFAR:
A message in the terminal displays which widget has focus.
