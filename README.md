# ttk_focus_test
Trying to figure out how to correctly code different focus commands so I can implement them into another program I'm messing around with.

Program identifies which widget has focus and displays a message accordingly. If there is no focus, the message will simply be "No focus"

With the help on stackoverflow, this project has been completed. Now the code learnt need to be implemented into another project.
