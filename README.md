# ttk_focus_test
Trying to figure out how to correctly code different focus commands so I can implement them into another program I'm messing around with.

TODO:
Have the entry field change when it gains and loses focus from the user.
Add different widgets that can 'gain' focus.
Change the entry text depending on which widget has focus.
~~
SOFAR:
Text sets itself to "Focus out" as soon as program is opened. That's all it does...
